# Dreadnought_py_Public

## What is Dreadnought.py Public?

The Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard with Rust+ API Integration is a web application designed to provide Rust game players with an intuitive and real-time monitoring solution. The project leverages a combination of Rust, Quart (a Python asynchronous web framework), and WebSockets to achieve seamless communication between the web application and the Rust+ API.

## Technologies used to build this solution

The web application is built on Quart, offering a user-friendly interface accessible from various devices. Users can log in using their credentials when they access the web app. If a new user, they have the option to register. Once authenticated, the user gains access to the dashboard, where they can monitor a Rust game server of their choosing.

## API

The bot utilizes the Rust+ API to gather essential information, including the server name, number of players online, maximum player capacity, and map data.

## How to deploy this program?

TODO: Add a tutorial on how to deploy

## Why is there only one commitment?

Due to sensitive tokens on the main repository, we are forced to create a public repo that will serve as a stable version of the main branch.
